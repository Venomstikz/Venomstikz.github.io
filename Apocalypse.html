<h2 id="wth">Artificial Intelligence</h2>

<h6>Probability: 0-10%</h6>

<p class="Kobe">Perhaps the most-discussed apocalyptic threat of the moment, this refers to the development of machines and software with human-level intelligence. Such intelligences could not be easily controlled - either by the groups creating them, or some international body - and would probably be able to boost their own intelligence. And if they decide humanity if of no value, they will be driven to build a world without humans. But such artificial intelligence could easily combat most other risks in the report - making it a tool of great potential. At the moment, no one knows whether there is a real risk of extreme machine intelligence and the researchers therefore give it a wide estimate of probability.</p>

<h2 id="wth2">Global Climate Change</h2>
<h6>Probability: 0.01%</h6>
<img class="Rondo" src ="https://yt3.ggpht.com/a-/AJLlDp25wTzeYcHYyvJgEBkAWFZHrI4nP14sFU2Jxg=s900-mo-c-c0xffffffff-rj-k-no" alt="Burning Earth" width="250">
<p class="Kobe">The report warns that climate change could be more extreme than some estimates suggest. The world's poorest countries could become completely uninhabitable. Climate change could lead to mass deaths, famines, social collapse, and mass migration.</p>

<h2 id="wth3">Nuclear War</h2>
<h6>Probability: 0.005%</h6>
<img class="Rondo" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vxNnUU3eRD0/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Nuclear Explosion" width= "220">

<p class="Kobe">Despite nuclear non-proliferation agreements and treaties agreeing to reduce the amount of nuclear bombs that militaries stockpile, the collection of nuclear bombs said to exist are in excess of 20,500 warheads. On average, each of these terrible devices measures 33,500 kilotons of explosive force, more than enough to destroy the surface of the planet.</p>
