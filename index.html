<p class="lol">Bunnies have adapted strangely to some of the recent nuclear explosions. The former populated area known as California,(now destroyed by nuclear war)home to many domestic rabbits. Is now a wasteland of it's former self. The streets are deserted with wreckage and debris everywhere. These rabbits however, survived the blast and suprisingly, the fallout. They somehow have absorbed the nuclear energy and have escaped the wrecage untouched. They now roam the areas near California with a strange ability. THEY EXPLODE. If you come into contact with one, run away immediately. Alert a local official and they will send in a team to exterminate it safely.</p>

<p class="lol">Following our first report on the large numbers of exploding rabbits, we have new information on a recent disease. The sudden outbreak of "dabbing" has recently appeared. This infectious disease causes humans to spontaneously lean their head into the crook of their elbow. giving the look that they have just sneezed. It can be seen most comonly in public schools and other largely populated areas. If you see someone in the streets "dabbing" do not hesitate in putting them down. The disease is highly contagious and will be contracted at the littlest of skin contact. If you become infected, there is curently no cure. You will die in 48 hours upon experiencing the first symptoms.</p>

<p class="lol">Even more recently, the world's water supply has become undrinkable. The water, no infected by radiation, causes extreme irritation, diarrhea, and in 99% of all cases, death. On top of that, FISH PEOPLE have been seen roaming around multiple bodies of water. If seen stay away. More information will be uncovered in the near future. For now they are labeled as an extreme threat and extremely dangerous. Over the past few days, the casualties have been heavy. There is only an estimated population of one million humans who are still alive and healthy. The number is soon to drop as we desperately try to find a source of hydration.</p> <li><a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_19967_10-real-sea-creatures-lifted-directly-from-your-nightmares.html">Some real life fish monsters</a></li>
